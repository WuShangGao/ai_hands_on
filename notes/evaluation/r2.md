$R^2$, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. It is a number between 0 and 1 that indicates the goodness of fit of a model.

Here's how $R^2$ is calculated and interpreted:

1. **Formula**: The formula for $R^2$ is:
   $$ R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{SS}_{\text{res}}}{\text{SS}_{\text{tot}}} $$
   where:
   - $\text{SS}_{\text{res}}$ is the residual sum of squares, which is the sum of the squares of the differences between the actual values and the predicted values by the model.
   - $\text{SS}_{\text{tot}}$ is the total sum of squares, which is the sum of the squares of the differences between the actual values and the mean of the actual values.

2. **Interpretation**: An $R^2$ value of 0 indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean, while an $R^2$ value of 1 indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean.

3. **Use in Model Evaluation**: $R^2$ is used to evaluate how well a regression model fits the data. A higher $R^2$ value generally indicates a better fit, but it's important to note that $R^2$ does not tell you whether the model is correct or whether the relationship between the variables is causal.

4. **Adjusted $R^2$**: In cases where multiple regression is used, the adjusted $R^2$ is often used instead. The adjusted $R^2$ adjusts the $R^2$ value for the number of predictors in the model to avoid overfitting. The formula for adjusted $R^2$ is:
   $$ \text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - (1 - R^2) \frac{n - 1}{n - k - 1} $$
   where $n$ is the number of observations and $k$ is the number of predictors in the model.

5. **Limitations**: While $R^2$ is a useful measure, it has limitations. For example, it does not penalize the inclusion of irrelevant variables in the model, and it may increase even if a variable that does not actually improve the model is added.

6. **Comparison with Other Metrics**: $R^2$ is often compared with other metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to get a more comprehensive understanding of model performance.

In summary, $R^2$ is a valuable tool for assessing the fit of a regression model, but it should be used in conjunction with other metrics and diagnostic tools to fully evaluate a model's performance.
