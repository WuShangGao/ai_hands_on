Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a widely used measure of the performance of an estimator or a model in regression analysis. It represents the average of the squares of the errorsâ€”that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.

Here's how to calculate MSE:

1. **Calculate the Error for Each Data Point**: For each data point, you calculate the error, which is the difference between the observed value and the predicted value.

2. **Square Each Error**: To give more weight to larger errors, you square each error. This step also removes any negative signs from the errors.

3. **Sum the Squared Errors**: Add up all the squared errors.

4. **Divide by the Number of Observations**: To get the average, you divide the sum of squared errors by the number of observations (n).

The formula for MSE is:

$$ \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 $$

where:
- $n$ is the number of observations.
- $y_i$ is the actual value of the $i$-th observation.
- $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value of the $i$-th observation.

MSE has several important properties:

- **Interpretability**: MSE is in the same units as the variable being predicted, which makes it easy to interpret.
- **Sensitivity to Outliers**: MSE is sensitive to outliers because it squares the errors. This means that large errors have a disproportionately large effect on the MSE.
- **Differentiability**: MSE is differentiable, which makes it suitable for optimization using gradient descent or other optimization techniques.
- **Positive Definite**: MSE is always non-negative, and it is zero if and only if all predictions are correct.

MSE is a common loss function used in machine learning for training models, especially in regression problems. It is also used to evaluate the performance of forecasting models. However, because of its sensitivity to outliers, other loss functions like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) may sometimes be preferred.
