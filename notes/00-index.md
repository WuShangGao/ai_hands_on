## Regression

Regression models can help determine the _relationship_ between variables. This type of model can predict values such as price, temperature, or age, thus uncovering relationships between variables as it analyzes data points.

### Simple Linear Regression (SLR)

Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to analyze the relationship between two variables, where one variable is considered to be an explanatory variable (independent variable) and the other is a response variable (dependent variable). The goal of simple linear regression is to model the relationship as a straight line, which can be used for prediction and understanding the strength and direction of the relationship.

#### Key components and steps
1. Load the training data
2. Set the feature data/independent variable (X) and the target variable/dependent variable (y)
3. Visualize the raw data to understand the distribution
4. Set up the Linear Regression Model
5. Model Fit (Train the model using training data)
6. Prediction
7. Model Validation (by comparing the model's performance on a hold-out/testing dataset)
8. Model Evaluation through MSE([[mean_squared_error]]) and R2 ([[r2]])


### Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is an extension of simple linear regression that allows for the analysis of the relationship between one dependent variable and multiple independent variables. It is a statistical method used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on the values of two or more independent variables.

#### Key components and steps
1. Load the training data
2. Visualize the raw data to understand the relationship between single independent variable and dependent variable
3. Set the feature data (X) and the target variable (y)
4. Build up a Multiple Linear Regression Model
5. Model Fit
6. Prediction
7. Model Validation (by comparing the model's performance on a hold-out/testing dataset)
8. Model Evaluation through MSE([[mean_squared_error]]) and R2 ([[r2]])
